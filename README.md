Developed an algorithm to predict the future price of Bitcoin using historical price and sentimental data. This project used USD/BTC price from Yahoo Fincance, along with data from wikipedia about edits to the Bitcoin page. These datas were merged then used to train a random forest model then switched to XGBoost model to improve accuracy. Developped a backtesting system and use a robust error metric to determine if the algorithm is performing well. This system is also able to make next-day predictions.
